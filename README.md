# Welcome to the Microsoft/ABB HackZurich2017 Challenge!

We are really glad you are here and we wish you a lot of fun during the Hack! Feel free to drop by our booths to have a chat and to ask us for help!

Here is how the repo is organized:
* ABB section for information specific to RobotStudio, YuMi and Robot Web Services.
* Microsoft Section for anything on the bot framework, the cognitive services or Azure in general.
* Misc section for projects showing complete connection between the robot and Azure.

Here below are a few FAQs.

## What is exactly the challenge?
The challenge is to animate the YuMi Robot and enable it to do some cool stuff using the Microsoft Azure Cloud. The definition of "cool stuff" is totally based on your interpretation! Give room to your creativity!
You can use ABB's predefined gestures or create new ones to best fit your challenge and you can use any of the Azure Services.
Here are the minimum criterias to be considered as winner of our challenge:
* Making at least one gesture with the YuMi.
* Using at least one Azure Service in your solution.

## How can I test my code without the YuMi?
Don't worry, we have an emulator for you with preprogrammed gestures you can try! You have three options:
* Come to our booth to get your RobotStudio on a flash drive (Only for Windows).
* Instantiate a preconfigured VM running RobotStudio (TODO tutorial). You will then be able to reach it from any platform!
* Download it directly [here](http://new.abb.com/products/robotics/robotstudio/downloads).

## How do I get my free Azure Access?
Drop at the Microsoft booth to get your free Azure Voucher!

## How to interact with the YuMi?
TODO ABB Ppl

## What if I am stuck?
Reach out to us! Due to the wide range of technologies allowed by this challenge we are not sure to be able to always help out, but we will try our best!
