# Welcome to the Microsoft/ABB HackZurich2017 Challenge!

We are really glad you are here and we wish you a lot of fun during the Hack! Feel free to drop by our booths to have a chat and to ask us for help!

Here is how the repo is organized:
* ABB section for information specific to RobotStudio, YuMi and Robot Web Services.
* Microsoft Section for anything on the bot framework, the cognitive services or Azure in general.
* Misc section for projects showing complete connection between the robot and Azure.

Here below are a few FAQs.

## What is exactly the challenge?
The challenge is to animate the YuMi Robot and enable it to do some cool stuff using the Microsoft Azure Cloud. The definition of "cool stuff" is totally based on your interpretation! Give room to your creativity!
You can use ABB's predefined gestures or create new ones to best fit your challenge and you can use any of the Azure Services.
Here are the minimum criterias to be considered as winner of our challenge:
* Making at least one gesture with the YuMi.
* Using at least one Azure Service in your solution.

## Getting Started
1. [Get started with Azure](https://github.com/Mandur/HackZurich2017/tree/master/Microsoft). Get a free Azure voucher at the Microsoft booth.
2. [Get started with RobotStudio](https://github.com/Mandur/HackZurich2017/tree/master/ABB). You will use RobotStudio to run a virtual robot. You can run it locally on your machine or in an Azure VM.
3. Have a look at the examples of how to connect the robot to the Azure cloud:
* [C#/Console](https://github.com/Mandur/HackZurich2017/tree/master/ABB/Examples/RemoteRobot), includes RemoteRobotLib which you can use as a starting point for your own robot code.
* [Python](https://github.com/Mandur/HackZurich2017/tree/master/ABB/Examples/PythonRobot)
* [C#/UWP](https://github.com/Mandur/HackZurich2017/tree/master/Misc/UWP_C%23)
* [JS/Electron](https://github.com/Mandur/HackZurich2017/tree/master/Misc/Javascript_Electron)
4. Create your own stuff. Good luck!
