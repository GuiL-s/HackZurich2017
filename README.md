# Welcome to the Microsoft/ABB HackZurich2017 Challenge!

We are really glad you are here and wish you a lot of fun during the Hack! Feel free to drop by our booth to have a chat and ask us for help!

Here is how the repo is organized:
* [ABB](ABB) section for information specific to RobotStudio, YuMi and Robot Web Services.
* [Microsoft](Microsoft) Section for anything on the bot framework, the cognitive services or Azure in general.
* [Misc](Misc) section for projects showing complete connection between the robot and Azure.

## What is exactly the challenge?
The challenge is to animate the YuMi Robot and enable it to do cool stuff using the Microsoft Azure Cloud. The definition of "cool stuff" is totally based on your interpretation! Give room to your creativity!

You can use ABB's predefined gestures or create new ones to best fit your challenge. You're welcome to use any of the Azure Services. Use any technology you see fit!

Here are the minimum criteria to be considered as winner of our challenge:
* Make at least one gesture with the YuMi.
* Use at least one Azure Service in your solution.

## Getting Started
1. [Get started with Azure](https://github.com/Mandur/HackZurich2017/tree/master/Microsoft). Get a free Azure voucher at the Microsoft booth.
2. [Get started with RobotStudio](https://github.com/Mandur/HackZurich2017/tree/master/ABB). You will use RobotStudio to run a virtual robot. You can run it locally on your machine or in an Azure VM.
3. Have a look at the examples of how to connect the robot to the Azure cloud:
* [C#/Console](https://github.com/Mandur/HackZurich2017/tree/master/ABB/Examples/RemoteRobot), includes RemoteRobotLib which you can use as a starting point for your own robot code.
* [Python](https://github.com/Mandur/HackZurich2017/tree/master/ABB/Examples/PythonRobot)
* [C#/UWP](https://github.com/Mandur/HackZurich2017/tree/master/Misc/UWP_C%23), complete example using both Azure and YuMi robot.
* [JS/Electron](https://github.com/Mandur/HackZurich2017/tree/master/Misc/Javascript_Electron), another complete example using both Azure and YuMi robot.
4. Create your own stuff. Good luck!

## What if I am stuck?
Reach out to us! Due to the wide range of technologies allowed by this challenge we are not sure to be able to always help out, but we will try our best!
