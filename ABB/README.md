# RobotStudio
RobotStudio is a simulation and programming tool for robots. For each virtual robot there is a **Virtual Controller (VC)** running the same software as the real robot. The VC controls robots motion and makes sure that is the same as for a real robot.

   * [Get RobotStudio](http://new.abb.com/products/robotics/robotstudio/downloads)
   
To run RobotStudio in a virtual machine you will need a license key. Come to our booth and we will provide you with one.

Learn more about RobotStudio by looking at the [tutorial videos](http://new.abb.com/products/robotics/robotstudio/tutorials). Here you can find out how to create your own movements and gestures. Also, come by our booth and we will help you!

## RobotStudio Pack&Go
Double click on the RobotStudio Pack&Go file HackZurich.rspag.

## Starting the virtual robot
Open RobotStudio and start the station HackZurich.rsstn if itâ€™s not already started.

Wait until the virtual controller is completely started. The controller state status at the bottom should be green.

## Starting the real robot
Take the FlexPendant and set the Program Pointer to main in the Production window.

# Robot Web Services
Robot Web Services is an HTTP based API for controlling robots. You will use it to control both virtual and real robots.

   * [API Reference](http://developercenter.robotstudio.com/blobproxy/devcenter/Robot_Web_Services/html/index.html)

# Connecting to the Virtual Controller
The VC will listen on port 80 for inbound HTTP traffic as soon as it is started. It is possible to interact with it via this REST API. Few things to note:
* The VC requires [Digest Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication) from the users with a default username/password of 'Default User'/'robotics' (without ' marks). Following classes have been tested to work with this communication:
    * [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/#) in Python. [Simple Example](Examples/PythonRobot)
    * [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) in Node.js [Example](../Misc/Javascript_Electron)
    * [Windows.Web.Http.HttpClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.web.http.httpclient) for C# Windows Store Application [Example](../Misc/UWP_C#)
    * [System.Net.Http.HttpClient](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.http.httpclient(v=vs.118).aspx) For C# and WinForms, WPF,... . [Example](Examples/RemoteRobot)

# Examples
  ## [RemoteRobot](https://github.com/Mandur/HackZurich2017/tree/master/ABB/Examples/RemoteRobot) (C#)
  A C# example with some (hopefully) reusable code.
  ## [PythonRobot](https://github.com/Mandur/HackZurich2017/tree/master/ABB/Examples/PythonRobot) (Python)
  A python example to get some communication set up with the robot.
  
There are also complete examples for [UWP](https://github.com/Mandur/HackZurich2017/tree/master/Misc/UWP_C%23) and in [JS](https://github.com/Mandur/HackZurich2017/tree/master/Misc/Javascript_Electron) that connect a robot with the Azure cloud services.

# Triggering motion with RobotStudio
The default gesture already configured in the robot are the following: 
* Home 
* Contempt
* Kiss
* No Clue
* Hands Up
* Suprised
* To Diss
* Anger
* Excited
